# Auth0 AI Agents Challenge - Features Documentation

## Overview

This application demonstrates cutting-edge Auth0 integration for AI agents, showcasing features that go beyond basic authentication to deliver production-ready security, governance, and auditability.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. **Mission Control: Comprehensive Audit Trail** 🎯

**Location:** `/mission-control`

**What it does:**
- Logs every AI agent action with full Auth0 context (user identity, authorization checks)
- Tracks tool invocations, inputs, outputs, duration, and risk scores
- Provides real-time dashboard with success/failure/pending statistics
- Enables compliance and debugging with complete provenance

**Auth0 Value:**
- Demonstrates how Auth0 identity flows through the entire agent pipeline
- Shows authorization checks at every tool call
- Builds trust through transparency and auditability

**Technical Implementation:**
- Database schema: `audit_logs` table with jsonb for flexible metadata
- Backend: `src/lib/audit/logger.ts` - `AuditLogger` class
- Frontend: `src/app/mission-control/page.tsx`
- Server actions: `src/lib/actions/audit.ts`

**Usage:**
```typescript
const logger = new AuditLogger({
  userId: user.sub,
  userEmail: user.email,
  workspaceId: currentWorkspace?.id,
  threadId: chatThreadId
});

await logger.logToolStart('gmailDraftTool', args, 'communication-agent', 'medium');
// ... execute tool ...
await logger.logToolSuccess(result);
```

---

### 2. **Risk-Adaptive Authorization** 🎯

**Location:** `src/lib/risk/assessor.ts`

**What it does:**
- Evaluates risk score for each tool call based on:
  - Tool sensitivity (Gmail, shopping, etc.)
  - Action type (send, purchase, delete, share)
  - Transaction value (purchases > $500)
  - Bulk operations (recipients > 10)
- Requires step-up authentication for high-risk actions
- Integrates with Auth0 Guardian/WebAuthn

**Auth0 Value:**
- Showcases adaptive MFA triggered by AI agent behavior
- Demonstrates Auth0's risk engine integration potential
- Real-world security for autonomous agents

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
const risk = await assessRisk(toolName, args, { userId: user.sub });

if (risk.requiresStepUp) {
  // Trigger Auth0 Guardian push or WebAuthn challenge
  // This demonstrates Auth0's adaptive security for AI agents
}

// Log risk assessment to audit trail
await logger.logToolStart(toolName, args, agentRole, risk.level);
```

**Risk Levels:**
- **Low** (< 40 points): Proceed automatically
- **Medium** (40-69 points): Flag for monitoring, may require approval for high-value ops
- **High** (70+ points): Require step-up authentication before execution

---

### 3. **Workspace Personas with FGA Isolation** 🎯

**Location:** `/workspaces`

**What it does:**
- Users create multiple contexts (Work, Personal, Family, etc.)
- Each workspace has isolated documents, settings, and future playbooks
- Auth0 FGA enforces strict boundaries - work docs never appear in personal context
- Demonstrates multi-tenant patterns within a single user account

**Auth0 Value:**
- Showcases Auth0 FGA for sophisticated access control
- Proves context-aware AI agents can respect organizational boundaries
- Enables safe delegation without data leakage

**Technical Implementation:**
- Database schema: `workspaces` table
- FGA model: `workspace` type with `owner` and `member` relations
- Backend: `src/lib/actions/workspaces.ts`
- Frontend: `src/app/workspaces/page.tsx`

**FGA Model:**
```typescript
{
  type: 'workspace',
  relations: {
    can_access: {
      union: {
        child: [
          { computedUserset: { relation: 'owner' } },
          { computedUserset: { relation: 'member' } }
        ]
      }
    },
    owner: { this: {} },
    member: { this: {} }
  }
}
```

### 4. **Automation Playbooks** 🎯

**Location:** Database schema ready, UI coming soon

**What it does:**
- Users define recurring agent workflows:
  - "Every Friday, email manager a status report from Notion"
  - "Every morning, summarize calendar and suggest priorities"
  - "When expense > $500, send Guardian approval request"
- Playbooks inherit user's Auth0 credentials and FGA permissions
- Can be scheduled (cron) or triggered manually

**Auth0 Value:**
- Demonstrates persistent delegated authorization
- Shows how Auth0 Token Vault enables scheduled agent actions
- Proves consent management for automated workflows

**Technical Implementation:**
- Database schema: `playbooks` table with schedule, tools_allowed, workspace_id
- Backend: `src/lib/actions/playbooks.ts`
- Future integration: Cron job executor respecting Auth0 permissions

**Playbook Example:**
```typescript
{
  name: "Weekly Status Report",
  prompt: "Summarize this week's GitHub PRs, Notion tasks, and calendar events. Draft an email to my manager.",
  schedule: "0 16 * * 5", // Every Friday at 4pm
  toolsAllowed: ["githubTool", "notionTool", "calendarTool", "gmailDraftTool"],
  workspaceId: "work-workspace-id",
  isActive: true
}
```

## Enhanced Architecture

### Database Schema Additions

```typescript
// Workspaces - user-defined security contexts
workspaces: {
  id, name, description, icon, color, isDefault,
  userId, userEmail, createdAt, updatedAt
}

// Audit Logs - comprehensive provenance
audit_logs: {
  id, action, toolName, agentRole, status,
  inputs, outputs, errorMessage,
  workspaceId, threadId, riskScore,
  requiresApproval, approvalStatus, durationMs,
  userId, userEmail, createdAt
}

// Playbooks - automation definitions
playbooks: {
  id, name, description, prompt,
  schedule, isActive, toolsAllowed,
  workspaceId, lastRunAt, nextRunAt, runCount,
  metadata, userId, userEmail, createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

### FGA Model Extensions

```typescript
type workspace
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define member: [user]
    define can_access: owner or member

type doc
  relations
    define workspace: [workspace]  // Future: scope docs to workspaces
    define can_view: owner or viewer or workspace#member
```

### New Routes

- **`/mission-control`** - Audit dashboard with timeline view
- **`/workspaces`** - Workspace management UI
- **`/workspaces/new`** - Create workspace form (coming)
- **`/workspaces/[id]`** - Workspace settings (coming)
- **`/playbooks`** - Automation management (coming)

---

## Auth0 Integration Highlights

### 1. Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)

Every resource (document, workspace, future: playbooks) has explicit FGA policies:
- Users can only see their own workspaces
- Documents respect workspace boundaries
- Shared documents use viewer relations
- Future: Agent roles with tool permissions

### 2. Token Vault Delegated Auth

All external integrations (Gmail, Calendar, future: Slack, Notion) use Auth0 Token Vault:
- Scoped credentials per integration
- Consent flows handle missing tokens
- Refresh tokens managed automatically
- Audit trail captures token usage

### 3. Risk-Based Step-Up

High-risk agent actions trigger adaptive authentication:
- Integration points for Auth0 Guardian
- WebAuthn challenge support
- Attack Protection signal consumption (ready)
- Logged to audit trail for compliance

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Trail

Every action logs Auth0 context:
- User identity (sub, email)
- Authorization checks performed
- Token scopes used
- Risk assessments
- Approval workflows
