# Auth0 AI Agents Challenge - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This document summarizes the enhancements made to Assistant0 for the Auth0 AI Agents Challenge.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Mission Control - Comprehensive Audit Trail**

**Status:** ✅ Fully Functional

**What it does:**
- Every AI agent action is now logged to a dedicated `audit_logs` table
- Real-time dashboard at `/mission-control` shows:
  - Success/failure/pending statistics
  - Timeline of all tool calls with timestamps
  - Risk scores (low/medium/high) for each action
  - Full Auth0 context (userId, userEmail)
  - Input/output inspection via expandable details
  - Duration metrics in milliseconds
  - Agent role identification

**Technical details:**
- Database table: `audit_logs` with 17 columns including jsonb for flexible metadata
- Backend class: `AuditLogger` in `src/lib/audit/logger.ts`
- Server actions: `getAuditLogsForUser()` in `src/lib/actions/audit.ts`
- Frontend: Full-featured dashboard in `src/app/mission-control/page.tsx`
- Navigation: Added to main nav bar for easy access

**How to use:**
1. Start a conversation with the agent
2. Use any tool (search, Gmail, calendar, etc.)
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/mission-control
4. See all actions logged with full provenance

---

### 2. **Risk-Adaptive Authorization System**

**Status:** ✅ Fully Functional

**What it does:**
- Every tool call is automatically assessed for risk before execution
- Risk scoring factors:
  - Tool sensitivity (Gmail, shopping = higher risk)
  - Action types (send, purchase, delete, share)
  - Transaction values (> $500 = high risk)
  - Bulk operations (> 10 recipients)
- Risk levels:
  - **Low** (< 40 points): Execute automatically
  - **Medium** (40-69 points): Flag for monitoring
  - **High** (70+ points): Require step-up authentication
- Integration-ready for Auth0 Guardian/WebAuthn challenges

**Technical details:**
- Risk engine: `assessRisk()` function in `src/lib/risk/assessor.ts`
- Returns: `{ level, score, factors, requiresStepUp }`
- Integrated into tool execution pipeline via `createAuditedTools()` wrapper
- High-risk tools return special response: `{ status: 'requires_step_up', message: '...', riskLevel: 'high' }`
- Risk scores logged to audit trail for compliance

**How to test:**
```typescript
// Low risk: profile lookup
ask("What's my user info?")
// → Risk: low, executes immediately

// High risk: expensive purchase
ask("Buy me a $1500 MacBook Pro")
// → Risk: high, returns step-up message
// → Check Mission Control to see "requires_step_up" log entry
```

### 3. **Multi-Agent Role Architecture**

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**What it does:**
- Tools are now assigned to specialized agent roles:
  - **knowledge-agent** - Search, document retrieval
  - **communication-agent** - Gmail search/draft
  - **scheduler-agent** - Calendar management
  - **commerce-agent** - Shopping operations
  - **profile-agent** - User info lookups
- Agent role displayed in audit logs and Mission Control
- Sets foundation for multi-agent orchestration in future iterations

**Technical details:**
- Role mapping: `TOOL_AGENT_ROLES` constant in `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- Logged to `audit_logs.agent_role` column
- Displayed with colored badges in Mission Control UI

---

### 4. **Workspaces Infrastructure**

**Status:** ✅ Schema Ready, UI Skeleton Complete

**What it does:**
- Database schema supports user-defined workspaces (Work, Personal, Family, etc.)
- Auth0 FGA model extended with `workspace` type and `owner`/`member` relations
- Default workspace auto-created on first user chat interaction
- Workspace management page at `/workspaces` shows existing contexts

**Technical details:**
- Database table: `workspaces` with 10 columns
- FGA model includes: `workspace` type with `can_access` relation computed from owner ∪ member
- Backend actions: Full CRUD in `src/lib/actions/workspaces.ts`
- Helpers: `ensureDefaultWorkspace()` in `src/lib/workspaces/helpers.ts`
- Frontend: Dashboard at `src/app/workspaces/page.tsx`
- Workspace ID flows through audit context to all tool calls

**Status note:** 
- ✅ Database schema migrated
- ✅ FGA model updated
- ✅ Default workspace creation
- ⏳ Workspace creation UI (placeholder page exists)
- ⏳ Document scoping by workspace (future)

---

### 5. **Automation Playbooks Infrastructure**

**Status:** ✅ Schema Ready, Actions Implemented

**What it does:**
- Database schema supports recurring agent automation definitions
- Playbooks store:
  - Name, description, prompt template
  - Schedule (cron expression or "manual")
  - Allowed tools list
  - Associated workspace
  - Execution history (last run, next run, run count)

**Technical details:**
- Database table: `playbooks` with 16 columns
- Backend actions: Full CRUD in `src/lib/actions/playbooks.ts`
- Functions: `createPlaybook()`, `getPlaybooksForUser()`, `togglePlaybookActive()`, `incrementPlaybookRunCount()`

**Status note:**
- ✅ Database schema migrated
- ✅ Server actions implemented
- ⏳ Execution engine (future)
- ⏳ UI for creating/managing playbooks (future)

**Example usage:**
```typescript
await createPlaybook({
  name: "Weekly Status Report",
  description: "Email manager with week's summary",
  prompt: "Summarize this week's calendar and Gmail, draft status email",
  schedule: "0 16 * * 5", // Friday 4pm
  toolsAllowed: ["getCalendarEventsTool", "gmailSearchTool", "gmailDraftTool"],
  workspaceId: workspaceId,
  isActive: true
});
```

### 6. **Enhanced System Prompt & UX**

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**What it does:**
- Agent now mentions Mission Control for auditability
- Explains step-up auth requirements when high-risk actions are blocked
- Instructs user to approve Guardian/WebAuthn and confirm before retrying
- Better error handling and user communication

**Technical details:**
- Updated `AGENT_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE` in `/api/chat/route.ts`
- Agent responds to `{ status: 'requires_step_up' }` with user-friendly message
- Logs "step_up_required" action to audit trail

- ⏳ Filtering documents by workspace in UI/backend
- **Why:** Requires connecting document upload to current workspace context

---

## ⏳ Not Yet Implemented (Next Steps)

### 1. Actual Step-Up Auth Flow
**Current state:** System detects high-risk and returns message
**Next:** Integrate Auth0 Guardian push or WebAuthn challenge API
**Effort:** Medium (1-2 days)

### 2. Playbook Execution Engine
**Current state:** Database schema and CRUD actions ready
**Next:** Cron job runner that executes playbooks with delegated Auth0 credentials
**Effort:** High (3-5 days)

### 3. Additional Integrations
**Suggested:**
- Slack connector with Token Vault
- Notion API integration
- GitHub issues/PRs integration
**Effort:** Medium per integration (1-2 days each)

### 4. Team Collaboration
**Suggested:**
- Invite users to workspaces
- Shared audit logs
- Multi-user approval workflows
**Effort:** High (5+ days)

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Mission Control Audit Logs

1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Login and start a chat
3. Use various tools:
   ```
   "What's my user info?"
   "Search for OpenAI"
   "Check my calendar"
   ```
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/mission-control
5. **Verify:**
   - ✅ All actions logged
   - ✅ Timestamps present
   - ✅ Agent roles displayed (profile-agent, knowledge-agent, scheduler-agent)
   - ✅ Risk scores shown
   - ✅ Can expand inputs/outputs
   - ✅ Duration metrics visible

### Test Risk Assessment

1. Low-risk action:
   ```
   "Tell me about my user profile"
   ```
   - Check Mission Control: risk should be "low"

2. Medium-risk action:
   ```
   "Search my Gmail for invoices"
   ```
   - Check Mission Control: risk should be "medium" (sensitive tool)

3. High-risk action:
   ```
   "Buy me a laptop for $1500"
   ```
   - **Expected:** Agent explains step-up auth required
   - Check Mission Control: risk should be "high", status "step_up_required"

### Test Workspaces

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/workspaces
2. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Page loads without errors
   - ✅ Shows "no workspaces" message (if first visit)
   - ⏳ After first chat, default workspace "Personal" should appear
3. Click "New workspace" link
   - ✅ Placeholder page loads explaining feature is coming

### Test FGA Model Update

1. Run: `npm run fga:init`
2. **Verify in console:**
   - ✅ New model ID printed
   - ✅ No errors
